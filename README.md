# 🌍 EnviroSense

*Smart Air Quality Prediction & Insights*

---

## 📖 Overview

**EnviroSense** is a machine learning-powered platform designed to **predict Air Quality Index (AQI)** for cities worldwide.
It processes pollutant data, applies **standardized AQI breakpoints (CPCB/US EPA)**, and uses multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to provide accurate AQI predictions along with confidence levels.

The tool is aimed at:
✔️ Environmental researchers
✔️ Policy makers
✔️ Smart city planners
✔️ Everyday citizens who care about clean air

---

## ✨ Features

* 📂 **Dataset ingestion**: Upload your own AQI dataset.
* ⚗️ **Data preprocessing**: Missing values handled, pollutants standardized.
* 📊 **AQI computation**: Based on pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃).
* 🧠 **Multiple ML Models**:

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* ✅ **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, RMSE, R², confidence percentage.
* 🔮 **Prediction mode**: Enter **city** + **date** → Get AQI predictions across models.
* 🏆 **Best model recommendation** with confidence score.
* 🎨 **Visualizations**: R² comparison, confusion matrices, performance metrics.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python 3.9+
* **Libraries**:

  * Data: `pandas`, `numpy`
  * Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * ML Models: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
  * UI/File Handling: `tkinter`, `google.colab` (for Colab support)
